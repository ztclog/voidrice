# The Voidrice

These are the dotfiles deployed by [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz) and as seen on
[Luke's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/lukesmithxyz).

- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- vim/nvim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf/ranger (file manager)
	- mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
	- imv/sxiv (image/gif viewer)
	- mpv (video player)
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
    - I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables moved into `~/.config/`

## Usage

These dotfiles are intended to go with numerous suckless programs I use:

- [dwm](https://github.com/ztclog/dwm) (window manager)
- [st](https://github.com/ztclog/st) (terminal emulator)

## Install these dotfiles and all dependencies

Use [LARBS](https://github.com/ztclog/LARBS) to autoinstall everything:

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ztclog/LARBS/master/larbs.sh
```

or clone the repo files directly to your home directory and install the
[dependencies](https://github.com/ztclog/LARBS/blob/master/progs.csv).
