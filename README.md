# The Voidrice

There are the configs mostly inspired by [Luke Smith](https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice).

- Settings for:
	- mpv (video player)
	- mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
	- vim/nvim (text editor)
	- lf/ranger (file manager)
	- imv/sxiv (image/gif viewer)
	- zsh/sheldon (shell & plugins)
    - transmission/rtorrent (torrent)
    - I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- Some environmental variables moved into `~/.config/`
    - fontconfig, gtk settings, vcs.conf, rime/fcitx configs
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` except mozilla/firefox files

## Usage

Choose the config(s) you need, just copy them to the proper config directory.
